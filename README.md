# Arcade-VSCode-Extension

An extension for Visual Studio Code which allows you to Start, Stop, Pause, and see time left for your Hack Club Arcade Session.
## Installation

The extension is currently under development so I've not uploaded it on the Vscode marketplace.

To Install it follow the steps below

```bash
  > git clone https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92 Arcade-VSCode-Extension.git
```
